# Veterinary Appointments

Web application in React with Hooks, it allows you to manage your pet's appointments. Visit it [here](https://elated-euclid-05182a.netlify.com/)

Project done following the tutorial of [React - La Gu√≠a Completa: Hooks Context Redux MERN +15 Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-de-principiante-a-experto-creando-mas-de-10-aplicaciones/)

## Description

Users can save their pet's appointments with all relevant information as time, date, symptom.

You can also delete appointments that do not interest you.

In addition, I have used the local storage so that data entered by the user is not lost on page reload.

## Technical tools

- React, managing state with Hooks
- Layout with HTML5 and Skeleton
- UUID library to set an unique ID to each appointment
- Deploy the project to Netlify

## Installation

To use the project locally, you need to install dependencies of the project with `npm install` and start a local server with `npm start`
